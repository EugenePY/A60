# Forest 65 PCB

Hi, Andrew nice work!

Since you are using the web based eda tool. I generaly do not have any problem 
with the tools, it very simple and have great integration with the pcb/eletronic 
component firms, but I suggest you still need to learn KiCAD, 

There are few benifit about kicad. 

1. it's open sourced.
2. it has a great supported by the eda/keyboard community.

Most of open sourced EE project are using kicad as their tools, and some of professional still prefer it to some commercial EDAs like EAGLE, Altium. 

there are few learning resource for kicad, one of most popular one is the [Ai03's 
Keyboard Guide](https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/page/pcb-guide-part-1---preparations)

You may follow  it to know how to use kicad. Kicad also has a lot of open sourced footprint libarary.

2. [Acherion Project Gondolindrim](https://github.com/AcheronProject)

# For current PCB files

I  add datasheet about ATMEGA32U4-AU, you can check your pins, reading the datasheet maybe very overwhelming in the first place, but I still recommanded to go through it. It's very benifitcial for you in the long run since you want to get into eletronic desin/EE. And other datasheet follows the similar priciple.

# TODOs

1. Please rewire your pcb in kicad.

# PCB comments

I think your pcb works, but there are few things need to be improved.
    
### The wire should not be too close to the pcb edge if the space allowed. 

    If the wire are too close to the edge it may break easily, but it just a minor things to notice, generaly it does not affect overall functionality.
